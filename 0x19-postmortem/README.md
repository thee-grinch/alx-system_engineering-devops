# Postmortem: Database Outage - February 12-19, 2024

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** February 12, 2024, 6:00 AM (UTC) to February 19, 2024, 6:00 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:** Complete system unavailability, affecting all users
- **Root Cause:** Critical failure in the database server due to hardware malfunction and inadequate failover mechanisms

## Timeline:
- **Detection:** 
  - Detected at 6:15 AM on February 12, 2024, through automated monitoring alerts
- **Actions Taken:** 
  - Initial investigation focused on network and server hardware
- **Misleading Paths:** 
  - Time wasted on diagnosing network issues initially
- **Escalation:** 
  - Incident escalated to database administration team and senior sysadmins
- **Resolution:** 
  - Faulty hardware replaced, failover mechanisms enhanced

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** 
  - Hardware malfunction in database server storage array, coupled with inadequate failover mechanisms
- **Resolution:** 
  - Faulty hardware replaced, failover mechanisms enhanced

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Enhance monitoring systems
  - Implement regular hardware inspections
  - Review and update failover mechanisms
- **Tasks:**
  1. Replace faulty hardware components
  2. Update monitoring configurations
  3. Conduct failover mechanism review
  4. Schedule regular maintenance windows
  
By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective measures, the system's resilience has been significantly improved to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future.
